<br> ``*Project Steps*``
<br>**1) Data Collecting (Parsing):**
News articles and research papers have been collected from numerous sources to build a sufficient model for the project.
<br>###Libraries used: Beautifulsoup & Newspaper

<br>??
<br>*Model Initiation:*
<br>??

##*Visualization:*
Using Wordclouds, clustering the AI trends regarding their respective industries is the last step before making the model ready for general use.

#**4) Deployment:**
After the NLP model and the wordclouds are ready to be presented, deployment is handled with ????.
